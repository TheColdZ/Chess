# Chess

Hello! And welcome to a test driven for-fun implementation of chess. 
The goal with this project is simply to remind myself of how to do TDD and using some patterns. Perhaps even show a future employeer that I am able to create a project in Java... 

Another goal is to get comfortable with gradle once again, using git and to get some code output in Java once again. 

If you wanna hire me, please do!
